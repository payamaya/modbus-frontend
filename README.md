# **Modbus Frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)**

This project is a **React Vite + TypeScript** application that serves as the frontend for a **Spring Boot + J2Mod** backend. The backend communicates with a **pymodbus slave**, allowing the user to read/write Modbus registers via an HTTP API.

## **üìå Features**

- Communicates with a **Spring Boot backend** over HTTP.
- Sends and retrieves data from a **Modbus slave** via the backend.
- Uses **React, Vite, and TypeScript** for a fast and scalable frontend.
- Configurable API base URL via `.env` file.
